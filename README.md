Each partial view needs its own view model, feel free to adjust how you will inject your view models.
This is mostly a UI project

This project presents an alternative approach to UI structuring in .NET MAUI applications, emphasizing the integration of a master page with partial views as a flexible substitute for the default Shell TabbedPage.

While Shell's TabbedPage provides convenient built-in navigation, its customization can sometimes be restrictive when aiming for highly specific UI/UX designs and behaviors. This solution offers granular control over application layout, enabling developers to achieve highly customized user interfaces that might be challenging to implement with standard Shell navigation.

By leveraging a master page in conjunction with other pages within a Shell application, this project streamlines UI editing and enhances design consistency. This approach ultimately leads to a more efficient development process for complex UI requirements in .NET MAUI applications.
