.NET MAUI Master Page with Partial Views
This project demonstrates an alternative approach to UI structuring in .NET MAUI applications, focusing on the integration of a master page with partial views instead of the default Shell TabbedPage.

While Shell's TabbedPage offers built-in navigation, it can sometimes be challenging to customize extensively to match specific UI/UX designs and behaviors. This solution provides a more flexible and granular control over the application's layout, allowing developers to achieve highly customized user interfaces.

By leveraging a master page in conjunction with other pages within a Shell application, this project offers a method to simplify UI editing and enhance design consistency, ultimately leading to a more streamlined development process for complex UI requirements.
